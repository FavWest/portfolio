    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
    <p>BA, Lewis & Clark College</p>
    <p>Worked at Alameda Beaumont Childcare as a preschool teacher. I know how to remain calm when everyone around me is screaming because there's a bug.</p>
    <p>Currently studying at Epicodus, March 2021-September 2021</p>
    <p><strong>Current Interests</strong></p>
    <p>I'm a student at Epicodus, a coding boot camp located in Portland, Oregon. After several years as a preschool teacher, I am looking for a job that can provide greater financial security for my family. A friend suggested I try coding and loaned me "Head First: Learn to Code." I tried some Python and loved it! I've also dipped my toes into Android programming, learning how to make phone apps using Java and XML in Android Studio. By joining Epicodus, I hope to develop my communication and collaboration skills, learn from others, and get ready for a professional role in the programming world. </p>
